Project 5

Description: 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
OSS:
	In this program, the Operating system simulator starts by allocating shared memory
for the Resource Descriptor array of 20. about 20% of those are then declared sharable and
each class gets a total number of 1-10 that can be used. then at random time intervals
child processes are forked off. then the OSS checks to see if any messages are waiting from the
children. if not it checks to see if there are any pending requests. if there are, the 
request is evaluated to be safe or not.(see Banker Algorithm below) if it is safe it is
the process is told by changing the shared memory to its child pid. finally the OSS
increments the clock and loops back.

USER:
	When the user is forked off, it first calculates a time that it will run
an event based on the shared memory clock and the bound given in the options of OSS.
when that event time passes a number from 0-2 is generated(0 only possible after 1 second)
0 means terminate and a message is sent to OSS to let it know.
1 means request and it awaits its request granted by waiting on shared memory.
2 means release and it waits on the shared memory for the OSS to tell it
that is is done releasing memory. then the process loops until a 0 is rolled or
the OSS kills it.

NOTE: to make the project look more life like the 0 is forced if the process
has received all of its max claims of resources.

Banker Algorithm:
	The banker algorithm is run with a request and the shared memory.
the request is simulated on copies of the current Resource Tables and
the algorithm tries to find a safe sequence of processes. if it cannot find
one then the request is deemed unsafe and is put to sleep until something 
changes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ending situations:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. The program runs for the specified timeout time, terminates all out-
    standing children, closes and deletes IPC data, then exits.
2. The program spawns 100 processes, waits for the timer to run out.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Assumptions:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to run:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ make clean
$ make
$ ./oss [-t Time in Seconds before timeout] [-v for verbose] [-b [Bound]]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    sharable was done wrong to make things bad. now i am adding it to PCB but not subtracting it from RD.
    appears to be working again with changes.

    Added full table print every 20 requests.
    bound B needed
    verbose needed
    100,000 line limit needed

    Took out the warnings. still need 5 things in note:
    output how many granted
    parameter for 0-B bound in user
    verbose setting being used
    lines counted and limited to 100,000
    log unsafe requests, every 20 requests output FULL table

    Changed the oss to not worry about sharables. this would result in negative numbers on that resource??? change that in oss to reflect.
    
    also changed note and some readme

commit 884b0d19fecf5173127537a3b83b3747da7845a6

    It is done. still need to add releases, readme, comments, re-read stuff.
    gonna eat and pray. :)

    Is it done? it seems to be working. maybe add comments and re-read description?
    Praise God it seems to be working.

     I think we have liftoff folks. Praise God he has changed my crappy code into something that works!
    Still need bankers algorithm which may be biggest part.

    We now have everything working for requests/releases of 1 class still need to do algorithmn

    It seems to be working currently for requests and terminations.
    Still need to work in releases, and the algorithm
    Maybe other things i forgot?

    Changed oss.c to get rid of the multilevel queue. still need testing.
    Next change should be on the user.c
